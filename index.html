        <p>Hi! I am Ayman Muneer Mohamed, a soon to be student in Nottingham Trent University with a major in Computer Science and AI. I am currently partaking in a programming course in my summer break called the Odin Project which is about basic Web Development. I have created this website as a way to record and display my progress over the completion of this course.</p>
